* trace through restart (d=0) and clause purging -- am I losing forced literals from learned unit clauses?
* why is pigeonhole_20_20 performance worse with trivial clauses?
* improve performance on waerden_5_5_177: -s1 and kPeekProb=0 solves it in < 1 s
* with kPeekProb=1, ./bin/cdcl -s1 -t -c test/bf0432-007.cnf crashes. why?
* compile out counters, timers, logging in OPT mode
* Make a script to test consistency (clause count, var count) and formatting of all test files
* ignore comments correctly in input. right now, "c p cnf 1 2" will fool us in preamble.
* use clang instead of gcc? seems to be a little faster on most examples.
