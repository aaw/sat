./bin/cdcl -s9 test/pigeonhole_7_6.cnf


* compile out counters, timers, logging in OPT mode
* implement clause purging in cdcl
* implement literal flushing in cdcl
* implement fsnark generator
* clean up signed/unsigned types, check-fail when adding new clauses that overflow in cdcl
* Make a script to test consistency (clause count, var count) and formatting of all test files
* ignore comments correctly in input. right now, "c p cnf 1 2" will fool us in preamble.
* use clang instead of gcc? seems to be a little faster on most examples.
