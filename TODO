* improve CDCL performance on waerden_5_5_177: -s1 and kPeekProb=0 solves it in < 1 s
* Make a script to test consistency (clause count, var count) and formatting of all test files
* ignore comments correctly in input. right now, "c p cnf 1 2" will fool us in preamble.
* use clang instead of gcc? seems to be a little faster on most examples.

* look.cc: update h scores on the fly during lookahead?
