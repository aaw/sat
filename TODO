* remove LBD-based restarts
* revisit clause purging in cdcl
* why is pigeonhole_20_20 performance worse with trivial clauses?
* improve performance on waerden_5_5_177: -s1 and kPeekProb=0 solves it in < 1 s
* compile out counters, timers, logging in OPT mode
* clean up signed/unsigned types, check-fail when adding new clauses that overflow in cdcl
* Make a script to test consistency (clause count, var count) and formatting of all test files
* ignore comments correctly in input. right now, "c p cnf 1 2" will fool us in preamble.
* use clang instead of gcc? seems to be a little faster on most examples.
