* implement fsnark generator
* implement non-redundant clauses in cdcl
* implement clause purging in cdcl
* clean up signed/unsigned types, check-fail when adding new clauses that overflow in cdcl
* Make a script to test consistency (clause count, var count) and formatting of all test files
* ignore comments correctly in input. right now, "c p cnf 1 2" will fool us in preamble.
